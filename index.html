  <p id="odinAge">Loading Odin's age...</p>

  <p>
    He is a very good boy. He's smarter than many humans, loves to sniff things, and vacuums fallen food off the floor. 
    He fancies a nap in the sunbeam on the hardwood floor on a lazy afternoon. He will paw at you and make a sneezing sound when he's waiting for scritches. He will curl up in the middle of your bed like a croissant if you let him. His best friend is his cousin Meeka, a pretty Mini Goldendoodle with long eyelashes.

    <h2>Care Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Odin is an early riser. He will probably wake up before you and scratch at your door for food. When you get annoyed enough and decide to get up, you can feed him a scoop of kibble, approx. filled to the second line. He'll probably have to go out for his business too.<br> 
                <img style="width: 250px" src="food-fill.png" alt="How much to fill Odin's food bowl"></li>
      <li>Until August 27th, he has to take his antibiotic medication every morning. You can put the pill inside a blueberry and feed it to him.</li>
      <li>During the day, he's pretty easy-going. If you're around to play with him and take him outside for a little bit, he would really appreciate it.</li>
      <li>He eats his supper at 5:30pm sharp (he's strangely time-conscious and will sit by his food bowl five minutes to). Same amount as breakfast.</li>
      <li>He enjoys a nice walk after supper.</li>
      <li>His favourite way to spend the evening is leaning on your lap on the couch. He's pretty chill.</li>
    </ul>
